= Libsymbols
_generate a CSV of the symbols in your lib files to help resolve link errors_

== Motivation

Given a number of link errors from the llvm/clang libraries it was not always obvious what libraries needed to be added to provide all the required symbols.


== Usage

----
bash libsymbols.sh OBJ_ROOT LIBS...

OBJ_ROOT - the root directory to search for the .obj files
           that make up the libs in question

LIBS     - all the .lib files to inspect for symbols
----

Output is sent to stdout by default, so you can redirect this to a file with `>`
Progress is directed to stderr.

This uses the MSVC tools, so vcvarsall.bat (or the platform equivalent) needs to be called on the terminal before using this utility.


== Output

Generates a CSV in the format

----
library.lib; object.obj; demangled symbol name/signature
----

e.g:

----
clangParse.lib; ParseAST.obj; void __cdecl clang::ParseAST(class clang::Sema &,bool,bool)
----

The output can then be searched via a text file, a spreadsheet editor, or using `grep` from the command line:

----
cat clang_symbols.csv | grep -F clang::ParseAST
----

(the -F makes grep do a literal string search, so it won't get confused by `*` s)
